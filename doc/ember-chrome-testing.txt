INTRODUCTION                                    *ember-qunit-testing*

Quickly run your Ember tests in a browser.

It is slow and tedious to go from a test in your editor to running that
test in the browser.  This plugin speeds up the testing process significantly.  When it's
set up you'll be able to run an individual test by:

1. Put your cursor inside a test body
2. Hit `<leader>M`.
3. Switch to Chrome
4. Type `Command + l` to quickly get to the address bar.
4. Paste your clipboard and hit enter.

If you switch apps quickly (via âŒ˜ - tab or alfred or something), this can be a
pretty quick process.

You can run tests for an entire module with `<leader>m`.


ENTIRE MODULE                                       *ember-qunit-testing-module*

The default mapping for focused test output is <leader>m.


FOCUSED                                           *ember-qunit-testing-focused*

The default mapping for focused test output is <leader>M.
